Mthropology, a concocted word derived from Material Anthropology, is a space where the public can interact with the collection from the Victoria and Albert Museum, scribble down notes as inspiration hits, and engage in dialogue with others by showcasing their work.

This was my first project and therefore no tests were written given that we were introduced to TDD after its completion.
Please note that the Rails app was created within the "mthropology" folder accidentally.
