<p id="introduction">As the worlds's largest museum of decorative arts and design, artists, craftspeople, heritage enthusiasts, and scholars often loitered along the galleries of the <strong>Victoria and Albert Museum</strong> at South Kensington, searching for the next spark of inspiration. But since the museum's collection comprised of over 4 million objects and spanned 5,000 years of material culture, only a minisule percentage is currently on display.<br>
<strong>Mthropology</strong>, a concocted word derived from Material Anthropology, is a space where the public can interact with these hidden gems, scribble down notes as inspiration hits, and engage in dialogue with others by showcasing their work. </p>
